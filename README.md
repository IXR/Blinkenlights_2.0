Learn to Solder Kit - DER BLINKENLIGHTS

Der Blinkenlights "Learn To Solder" kit is a basic oscillator circuit (astable multivibrator) driving two LEDs for an alternating light flashing effect. The kit is designed to be a low-cost, entry level project to teach the basics of soldering. It is intended for those who have never soldered before, and is simple enough that even young children should be able to assemble it (with supervision). Furthermore, it has a nice variety of basic electronic components, so it is a good introduction to electronics as well.

Goals for this kit are:
* Simplicity - any beginner should be able to do it, and it should not take a very long time
* Sufficient learning experience - it should not be so simple that the student doesn't learn much. 1 LED on a battery does not provide much learning.
* Low cost - it should be cheap enough that it's a no-brainer for cost vs. benefit. Also, to make it cost-suitable for scout troops or school classes. $5-$10 range.
* Income source - There should be enough margin to make it a nice fund-raiser item for IXR

The kit contains:
* 1x printed circuit board
* 2x 100KΩ resistors (1/4W 5% carbon-film)
* 2x 220Ω resistors (1/4W 5% carbon-film)
* 2x NPN transistors (2N3904, TO-92-3 Kinked Lead)
* 2x 10μF, 16V capacitors (radial, general purpose, 4x7mm case)
* 2x light-emitting diodes (5mm, red or green)
* 1x battery holder (Keystone 3002, 20mm coin cell, surface mount)
* 1x CR2032 Battery (3V, 20x3.2mm, 200mA)
